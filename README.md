# Portfolio

This is the final project for the course **_50 Things You Need to Know About the Internet_** of the [**EPFL Extension School**](https://www.extensionschool.ch/foundations-of-digital-literacy-and-the-internet). The goal was to create a website using one of the 6 different original website templates available. The template chosen was a portfolio website (see resources folder).

This project was originally submitted in July 2018.

This project has been developed by [_Laura Elena GÃ³mez_](https://elenagoto.ch)
